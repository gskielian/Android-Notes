## Description

There are some caveats and root-only features which will block/unlock features your usual Linux operating system may take for granted.

## Caveats:

* websockets not supported in webview naturally


## Requires rooting:
* /etc/hostname blocked without rooting
* cannot connect to adhoc network without rooting
